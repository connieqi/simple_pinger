simple_pinger
=============
Simple script to ping a set of IP addresses and report which ones are responsive and which ones are not.

My use case: One year in college, I lived with 43 other people in two neighboring houses. Our LAN consisted of six wireless access points, two switches, a router and two modems. The devices were old and our internet was constantly going down, so I made this fun script to speed up the process of diagnosing problems when they arose.
